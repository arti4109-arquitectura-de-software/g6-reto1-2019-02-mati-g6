# CCS VehicleControl Architechture 

## Description
In this project we are looking to show the flow of communications between the different components of the CCS vehicle monitoring system, taking into account the technical decisions and the proposed architecture for this solution. Communication is generated from the arrival of the signals to the message broker to the notifications component.
